TwitchXP - Windows XP compatible Twitch.tv streams playlist fetcher.
This tool will help a lot if you still using Windows XP or old hardware which incapable
to play Twitch.tv streams smoothly in Internet Browser via Flash (slow) or HTML5 (very slow).
It's not a video player so you'll need to download and install one separately (see below).
Also note that higher video resolutions requires more CPU / GPU power to decode and render,
so try to use 480p or 360p streams if video playback has a lot of dropped frames.
And of course you can still use this tool even under Windows Vista / 7 / 8 / 10 if you wish so.

You need to know that Twitch.tv uses HLS protocol for streaming:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming
Not any video player has HLS support, even less can play it properly and only a few works under Windows XP.
TwitchXP itself can work even under Windows 98, but you probably didn't find any video player for HLS streams compatible with that system.

Please note that since October 2019 Twitch.tv updates their HTTPS encryption and you may be unable
to download playlist under Windows XP or older system anymore. In that case you'll need to download
and place to the same folder with this tool "ssleay32.dll" and "libeay32.dll" files from OpenSSL.
As example you can get library files here:
https://indy.fulgan.com/SSL
Download something like "openssl-1.0.2q-i386-win32.zip" - you'll need an archive with "win32" in name.
Note that library files from this link locked on system version 5.x which means you
can't use them under Windows 98 or older (4.x), because you'll need at least Windows 2000.

You can test TwitchXP on any always streaming 24/7 channels:
https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Always%20On
Note that even those channels can go offline sometimes or got desynced or even mute sound.

You can use "default system player" to play selected stream. In that case path to the player
executable will be obtained from the software associated in the system with the .AVI video files.

But if your system player doesn't support HLS protocol or you want another player - read further.

All software mentioned below are freeware.

There are at least two HLS-compatible players for Windows XP:

- VLC
  with GUI, also works under Windows 10
  https://www.videolan.org/vlc/

- ffplay
  no GUI (console application), works under Windows XP

Most recent ffplay/ffmpeg builds with HLS protocol and Windows XP support available here by Sherpya:
https://oss.netfarm.it/mplayer/

You need to download and extract "ffplay.exe" from the ffmpeg archive to the same folder with the "TwitchXP.exe" file.
7-Zip file archiver can be downloaded here if you don't have it or don't have any other archiver already installed with the 7z support:
http://www.7-zip.org/download.html

Recommended commandline arguments to run ffplay from TwitchXP with "custom player" option:

ffplay.exe -autoexit -framedrop -hide_banner -nostats -loglevel quiet -window_title ffplay

Also check "Hide player console window" option in TwitchXP to hide console window if you don't need it.

Note that ffplay can play HLS streams without issues but MPlayer stutter when playing, more info can be found there:

If your preferred video player requires URL to be the first argument you can use this "playit.bat" file:

@start "" player.exe "%~1" -argument2 -argument3 -etc

And just use "playit.bat" (without quotes) as commandline for "custom player" in TwitchXP.
Replace "-argument2", "-argument3" and "-etc" with any required arguments to the player or remove them if not needed.
